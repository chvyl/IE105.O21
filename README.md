## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Drebin, which contains APK files labeled as Benign-2015. The dataset can be obtained from [CIC](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/andmal2017.html).

## Description
This repository contains Python scripts (`testcode2.py` and `apk_to_rgb.py`) for converting APK files into Grayscale and RGB images. The `testcode2.py` script is designed to convert multiple APK files in a directory, while `apk_to_rgb.py` can be used to convert a single APK file. These scripts are particularly useful for preprocessing APK files for machine learning tasks, such as malware detection.
